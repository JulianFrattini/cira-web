# CiRA Web Interface

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/JulianFrattini/cira-web)](./LICENSE)

This repository implements a web interface for the [CiRA functionality](https://github.com/JulianFrattini/cira). It replaces a previous, static version of the web interface with a more modern approach employing the [React.js](https://react.dev/) framework.

## Setup

To set up the CiRA web interface, conduct the following steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository and set the following values:
    * `PORT_FRONTEND`: The port on which the frontend React page will be hosted and exposed.
2. Start the containers via `docker-compose up`.
